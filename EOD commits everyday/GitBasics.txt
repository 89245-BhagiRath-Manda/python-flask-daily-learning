🌱 Git & GitHub – Beginner Friendly Notes

(For someone who is completely new to Git and GitHub)

1️⃣ What problem do Git and GitHub solve?

Imagine this situation 👇
You are working on a project and:

You change code and something breaks

You want to go back to yesterday’s working code

Multiple people work on the same project

Files are shared on WhatsApp / Drive / Email

Someone overwrites someone else’s changes

This becomes messy and risky.

👉 Git and GitHub solve this problem.

2️⃣ What is Git?

Git is a version control system.

In simple words:

Git keeps track of every change you make in your code.

Git helps you:

Save code history

Go back to older versions

Work safely without fear

Experiment without breaking the project

Important point

✅ Git works on your computer
❌ Git does NOT need internet

3️⃣ What is GitHub?

GitHub is an online platform.

In simple words:

GitHub is a place where your Git projects are stored online.

GitHub helps you:

Store code online

Share code with team

Collaborate with others

Backup your work

Review code

Important point

❌ GitHub is NOT Git
✅ GitHub uses Git internally

4️⃣ Git vs GitHub (Very Important Difference)
Git	GitHub
Tool	Platform
Runs on laptop	Runs on internet
Tracks code changes	Stores code online
No account needed	Account required
Works offline	Needs internet

👉 Git = notebook
👉 GitHub = Google Drive

5️⃣ Basic Terms You Must Know
📁 Repository (Repo)

A folder that contains:

Project files

Git history

Example:

my-project/

💾 Commit

A save point in Git.

Think like:

“I want to save my progress now.”

🌿 Branch

A separate line of work.

Used to:

Develop features

Fix bugs

Experiment safely

🌐 Remote

Connection to GitHub.

Git needs to know:

“Where should I push my code?”

6️⃣ Basic Git Workflow (Big Picture)
Edit code
↓
git add
↓
git commit
↓
git push


This is the core cycle.

7️⃣ Essential Git Commands (With Examples)
🔹 Check Git version
git --version

🔹 Create a new Git repository
git init


Turns a normal folder into a Git repository.

🔹 Check current status
git status


Shows:

Modified files

Staged files

Clean state

🔹 Add files for commit
git add file.txt


Add all files:

git add .

🔹 Commit changes
git commit -m "Added login feature"


👉 Always write clear messages.

🔹 Connect to GitHub (one time)
git remote add origin <repo-url>


Example:

git remote add origin git@github.com:user/project.git

🔹 Push code to GitHub
git push


First time only:

git push -u origin main

🔹 Pull latest code from GitHub
git pull


Used when:

Someone else pushed code

You want latest updates

🔹 Clone a repository from GitHub
git clone <repo-url>


Example:

git clone git@github.com:user/project.git

8️⃣ Daily Commands You Will Use Most
git status
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git pull
git push


👉 80% of daily work uses only these commands.

9️⃣ Common Beginner Mistakes (And Tips)
❌ Forgetting to add files

✔ Always run git status before commit

❌ Wrong commit message

✔ Write meaningful messages

Bad:

update


Good:

Add user login validation

❌ Fear of Git

✔ Git never changes code without permission
✔ Git does not push automatically

🔟 Why Companies Use Git & GitHub

Team collaboration

Code safety

Clear history

Rollback support

Code reviews

Industry standard

👉 Knowing Git is mandatory in software jobs.

1️⃣1️⃣ Simple Mental Model (Remember This)

Git tracks changes

Commit saves progress

Push sends code to GitHub

Pull brings code from GitHub

✅ Final Summary

Git = local version control

GitHub = online code storage

Git keeps history

GitHub enables collaboration

Learn basics → practice daily → confidence grows

🧠 Message to New Joiner

Don’t try to remember everything at once.
Start with:

git status

git add

git commit

git pull

git push

Git becomes easy with practice, not memorization.
