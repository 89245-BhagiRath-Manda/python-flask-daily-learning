🧠 Daily Learning: Git, GitHub, SSH & Multi-Account Workflow (Windows)
📌 Background / Problem Statement

While setting up my development environment on Windows, I faced multiple issues related to:

Reinstalling Git cleanly

Using one system with two GitHub accounts (personal + work)

Confusion between clone vs copy–paste

Push errors due to missing remotes

Conflicts between local and remote history

Fear of accidentally pushing code to work GitHub

The goal was:

Safe personal development (push allowed)

Safe work setup (pull/fetch only)

Clean, repeatable, professional Git workflow

🔹 Phase 1: Clean Git Setup (Windows)
What I learned

A broken Git install can cause hidden PATH and SSH issues

Always do a clean uninstall + reinstall

Key steps

Uninstall Git

Delete leftover folders:

Git install directories

.gitconfig

.ssh

Reinstall Git with:

Git from command line + 3rd party tools

OpenSSH

MinTTY terminal

main as default branch

Verification
git --version

🔹 Phase 2: Understanding Git vs GitHub vs Folder Copy
Core realization

Copying project files ≠ cloning a GitHub repository

Copy–paste does NOT bring:

Git history

Remote connection

Branch tracking

Only git clone creates a full Git–GitHub link

🔹 Phase 3: SSH Setup for Multiple GitHub Accounts
What problem I had

One machine

Two GitHub accounts

Needed to avoid login/logout and wrong commits

Solution: SSH keys + config (one-time setup)
Generate keys
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "personal"
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "work"

SSH config concept

Use host aliases to decide which key is used:

github-personal

github-work

Result:

Same laptop

Same Git Bash

Different accounts automatically

SSH setup is one-time only, never repeated.

🔹 Phase 4: Correct Folder Structure (Mental Clarity)
D:\Git\
 ├─ Personal\
 └─ Work\


Benefits:

No confusion

Clear separation

Easy VS Code / GitHub Desktop usage

🔹 Phase 5: When “git push” DOES NOT work
Common mistake

I expected git push to work automatically, but Git showed:

No configured push destination

Why this happens

Folder was copied

Repo was re-initialized

Remote was missing

Fix (one-time per repo)
git remote add origin <ssh-url>
git push -u origin main


After this:

git push


works forever.

🔹 Phase 6: “Rejected – fetch first” Error
Cause

GitHub already had commits

Local repo started as a new/root commit

Histories were unrelated

Safe fix
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories
git push -u origin main

Key learning

Git protects history by default

Never force push unless you fully understand consequences

🔹 Phase 7: Git Identity (Very Important)
Problem

Git didn’t know who the author was:

Author identity unknown

Correct professional approach

Set identity per repository, not globally.

Personal repo
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "personal-email"

Work repo
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "work-email"


This prevents:

Wrong email on commits

Professional issues later

🔹 Phase 8: Safe Work Repo (Pull-Only Mode)
Requirement

I must never push to work GitHub

Only fetch/pull updates

Safety strategy
Normal pull
git pull

Extra protection (recommended)
git remote set-url --push origin DISABLED


Result:

git pull → works

git push → impossible by mistake

🔹 Phase 9: GitHub Desktop + Git Bash (Best Practice)
Real-world workflow

GitHub Desktop → daily commits, pull, push (UI)

Git Bash → fixes, learning, advanced commands

Both tools use the same SSH setup.

🔹 Core Commands I Learned
Basic
git status
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git pull
git push

Setup / Fixes
git init
git remote -v
git remote add origin <url>
git branch
git checkout

History / Conflicts
git pull --allow-unrelated-histories
git restore <file>

Safety
git remote set-url --push origin DISABLED

🧠 Final Understanding (Most Important)

Git never pushes automatically

SSH setup is one-time

Clone once → push forever

Copy–paste needs manual remote linking

Folder location does NOT affect GitHub

Discipline > shortcuts

✅ Outcome

After this process, I can confidently:

Use one laptop for multiple GitHub accounts

Work on many repos daily without confusion

Protect work repositories from accidental pushes

Debug Git errors calmly and logically

Explain Git fundamentals to others
